+ This project focuses on demonstrating the use of Python libraries such as NLTK, OS, chardet, and re to perform word distribution analysis and n-gram analysis on a corpus of text files. 
+ The project explains the importance of word distribution analysis in NLP and its applications, such as topic modeling. The project explains the steps involved in cleaning the text, tokenizing, removing non-alphabetic words and stop words, and computing the frequency distribution of words. 
+ The implementation of n-grams analysis helps in identifying patterns of word use, language structure and it suggests that the material seems to target a youthful readership, potentially with the intention of imparting knowledge or values, youthful characters in romantic or social situation and the overall content might be taken from the books or 
magazines. 

+ Additional investigation could be conducted by utilizing more advanced n-gram models or alternative techniques to acquire deeper comprehension of the text's composition and meaning.
